      'A Christian grows closer to God and is strengthened in faith by spending time with him daily. There are three ways we can all do this: Reading the Bible, praying and connecting with the church. <br /><br />Let’s look at spending time with God in these three ways:<br /><br />+ <b> We get to know God through reading the Bible. </b>  The Bible is also called ‘the Word of God’. That is because God speaks to us and reveals his love for us through the Bible. It shows us how we can know him and live in his love. As we read the Bible, our hearts and minds are changed by its truth. We get to know what God is like, and we understand his good plans and purposes for our lives.  Click here for an introduction to the Bible.<br />+ <b> We also get to know God through prayer. </b>  Prayer is simply talking with God. As we speak with him, he also speaks with us in different ways. He answers us, he encourages our hearts, he guides us and gives us strength.<br />+ <b> We get to know God through his church. </b>  The church is the family of God, of which all believers are members.  As we connect with the family of God and worship him together, we grow in faith and love.',

      'When a baby is born, it’s counted as part of the family from the very beginning.<br /><br />There is nothing a new baby must do to be accepted as a child. The baby doesn’t have to behave in a certain way or pass a test. It just is a son or daughter. Its identity is a child. He or she immediately has a relationship with their father, mother and siblings. What is more, he or she is immediately recognized by law as a child of the parents.<br /><br />The Bible is abundantly clear: When someone believes in Jesus, they immediately become a child of God and are accepted as a full member of his family.',
